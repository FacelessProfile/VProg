# Stages Description

## 1. Random Walk

Algorithm is pretty simple

Here is a class Human with an Move method that takes 1 arg: human object walking time\
Movement developed according to RandomWalk algorithm:\
X and Y cords changing formulas:\
* distance = speed * time 
* dx/dy = (random(0.0 : 1.1) * 2 - 1) * distance)
